# this is a datapack for the Origins Mod for minecraft
# It runs on 1.19, haven't checked other versions but anything above (1.19.1, 1.19.2 ect.) should work
# Coding, Balnacing (as if there is any), all the fun stuff: FtheP
# Main concept Doovy#4935 on the official origins discord server on the #origin-ideas channel
# Yes I have Doovy's allowance to code it and upload on my Github page
# If there are any grammar or vocabulary errors, sorry, english is not my first language
# By reporting errors you help out a ton, and I'm always open to feedback
# You can use this datapack on any origins server, private or public. (would be nice if you gave me some credit tho)
